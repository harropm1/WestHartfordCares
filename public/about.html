                        <p>West Hartford Cares started 3 years ago when Peggy, Sharon, and Lisa met while volunteering at the Women's Shelter in Hartford. As they talked, they learned that they all lived in West Hartford, and they had been looking for more volunteer opportunities within their own community also. It took about a year to get approval from the town, but West Hartford Cares is now authorized by the town to organize various volunteer and community service projects. We work with community groups, especially Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and students.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Recently, we opened our community service projects to the public. As of right now, we have 4 locations that teams can sign up for. The first is the Women's Shelter in Hartford. Right now, we have a women's only team volunteering there, but they will accept volunteers of any gender. Here we serve food, assist with maintenance, help with cleaning, and organize the food pantry.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The next location is actually a few different locations all over West Hartford, the playgrounds! We currently have a group of teenagers helping with this, and a group of people over 60 that decided to join them. Every week or so, the group picks a new park where they clean up garbage, rake, fill woodchips, and make the town aware of any broken equipment.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The third location is also a few different locations all over West Hartford also, the trails and bike paths! The teams here will clear leaves and branches, fill in woodchips or dirt, maintain trail markers (if there are any), and any other projects they can think of.</p>

                        <p>The last location (as of now), is Westmoor Park on Flagg Rd. Westmoor Park is an environmental education center with a demonstration farm, wildflower meadows, gardens, trails and ponds. Our volunteers help with planting and maintaining the gardens, caring for animals, and general maintenance (including building a new fence).</p>
