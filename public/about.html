                    <p>West Hartford Cares started three years ago when Peggy, Sharon, and Lisa met while volunteering at the Women's Shelter in Hartford. As they talked, they learned that they all lived in West Hartford, and they had been looking for more volunteer opportunities within their own community also. It took about a year to get approval from the town, but West Hartford Cares is now authorized by the town to organize various volunteer and community service projects. We work with community groups, especially Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and students.</p>

                    <p>Recently, we opened our community service projects to the public. As of right now, we have eight locations that teams can sign up for. The first is the Women's Shelter in Hartford. Right now, we have a women's only team volunteering there, but they will accept volunteers of any gender. Here we serve food, assist with maintenance, help with cleaning, and organize the food pantry. The next location is actually a few different locations all over West Hartford, the playgrounds! We currently have a group of teenagers helping with this, and a group of people over 60 that decided to join them. Every week or so, the group picks a new park where they clean up garbage, rake, fill woodchips, and make the town aware of any broken equipment.</p>

                    <p>The third location is also a few different locations all over West Hartford also, the trails and bike paths! The teams here will clear leaves and branches, fill in woodchips or dirt, maintain trail markers (if there are any), and any other projects they can think of. Location four is the West Hartford Animal Shelter. Here our volunteers play with dogs and cats, help bathe the animals, clean kennels and cages, and help organize any donations.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Location five is Westmoor Park on Flagg Rd. Westmoor Park is an environmental education center with a demonstration farm, wildflower meadows, gardens, trails and ponds. Our volunteers help with planting and maintaining the gardens, caring for animals, and general maintenance (including building a new fence). Our sixth location is also in various locations around town, this time, in the schools. Volunteers of many ages are tutoring students after school and providing extra help with math, reading, writing, science, and history.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The seventh location is the West Hartford Food Pantry, located at various churches and temples around town. Volunteers here organize donations, create packages, and run food pick-up days twice a month, which can include setting food out, handing out boxes and fresh vegetables (from Westmoor Park), and cleaning up. Our last location (for now), is at the various libraries around town. Our library volunteers assist with shelving books; showing people how to use the computer, printer, or fax machine; reading to children; and helping library visitors find books.</p>
